        <p>Hello world</p> 
        <p>
          HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
          Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
          <em>share pictures</em> of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.
